# TypeScript Foundations Project

## Overview

This project is designed to help you master TypeScript fundamentals through practical examples and exercises. It covers various topics including algorithms, data structures, clean code principles, and SOLID design principles.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for algorithms, data structures, clean code examples, and SOLID principles.
  - **algorithms/**: Implementation of various algorithms.
    - **sorting/**: Sorting algorithms like bubble sort and quicksort.
    - **dataStructures/**: Basic data structures such as stacks and queues.
  - **cleanCode/**: Examples demonstrating clean code practices.
  - **solid/**: Explanations and examples of SOLID principles.
  - **types/**: TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the project.
  
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the algorithms implemented in the `src/algorithms` directory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ts-foundations
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement various sorting algorithms.
- Learn about basic data structures and their operations.
- Apply clean code principles in your coding practices.
- Grasp the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding more algorithms, data structures, or examples of clean code practices. Open an issue or submit a pull request for any suggestions or improvements.
